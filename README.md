## II-About the project:
⚡Patika team decided to open a virtual store where electronic goods are sold and adds that this store will make the product management system from you, the trail volunteers. The name of the Virtual Store will be "PatikaStore".

⚡The Case given by the company was made in accordance with Object Oriented Programming (OOP) using the Java language because there was a specific language request from us in the Case given by the company.

⚡Nothing much was done by adhering to the Case that was asked to be done one-on-one.

⚡In order to conveniently check that the verification steps have taken place, the output has been taken on the console.

⚡With the created reusable methods, it was aimed to comply with the solid principles of the project.
